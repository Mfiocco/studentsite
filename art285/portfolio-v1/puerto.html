                        <p>The challenge for this project was to capture the complexities and nuances of the city
                            while simplifying its essence to create a logo that resonates with the local people as
                            well as extendeds a warm welcome to visitors.

                            city's heritage and greet visitors with the friendly spirit of its local people.

                    <div class="column one-half">
                        <p>Throughout my research I identified important themes that I wanted to explore. I
                            looked into the history behind the city and how it emerged as a touristic hotspot. I
                            explored the culture, examining arts, textiles, ceramics, folklore and geographical
                            importance. The story of a quaint fishing village that gained prominence as a shipping port
                            particularly captured my attention, as did the folklore surrounding the town's name. These
                            themes, along with others, allowed me to immerse myself in the important heritage of the
                            town.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column one-half">
                        <p>Focusing my research on key themes was crucial to guiding my sketching process. From there, I
                            experimented with different logo styles and explored various directions that could express
                            these themes until I settled on three concepts that were strong enough to move forward with.

                <p class="tab observe-me animate-from-right">The next step was to refine these concepts through
                    Illustrator, where I enjoyed the
                    challenge of translating my sketches into vector design. Here I was also able to experiment pairing
                    type with each concept in order to bring the combination mark together.

                    <p>Among the warm water and picturesque beaches, there is an infamouse surf break that gathers
                        surfers from around the world. The iconic wave has transformed this quiet fishing village
                        into a thriving beach town, hosting millions of visitors annually. Drawing inspiration from
                        traditional Oaxacan patterns, the wave signifies the city's connection to the ocean.</p>

                    <h4 class="iteration-titletour">Bienvenido "Welcome"</h4>
                    <p>This concept was inspired by traditional Oaxacan ceramics. The use of red clay spans
                        centuries and is a beautiful aspect of Mexican culture. The pot is seen as a gift, welcoming
                        visitors to a culturally rich land. The face on the pot is kind and warm but should be
                        received with respect. There is a coffee plant extending from the top of the pot, honoring
                        the port's history, when coffee was shipped from the harbor.</p>

                    <h4 class="iteration-titletour">La Escondida "The Hidden One"</h4>
                    <p>This concept was inspired by the tale of a young indigenious woman who was kidnapped by
                        spanish pirates. While anchored in the bay, she managed to escape one night and swim ashore,
                        hiding in the jungle as they searched for her. She was never found and they gave her the
                        name "la escondida", the hidden one, which soon evolved into the name of the town. I wanted
                        to show an abstract view of swell filling into the bay that slowly transitions to a woman's
                        face, implying a hidden woman.</p>

                <p class="tab observe-me animate-from-right">For the final design, I chose to go with the traditional
                    red clay pottery. It resonated
                    effectively with the target audience, while beautifully capturing the town's rich heritage and
                    culture. I paired the welcoming mark with a slab serif to convey strength and confidence, reflecting
                    the character of Puerto Escondido's peopleâ€”a delicate blend of pride and hospitality.
